# Extreme_Carzz
This is a game made by Python and Pygame for the event ```pythagoras```.
This is my take on the topic given to us: __car race__
In this game, we have to avoid crashing into the aproaching cars.

To install pygame, type: `pip install pygame` into the command prompt or terminal.


# Instructions
- (This game requires the module pygame to be installed.)
- To play the game using xtreme_car_race.py `git clone` all the dependencies into a directory with the source code.
- There is an executable file provided to play the game without having python installed.
- All the rules of the game is given in the `Rules` section in the game.
