# car_race


# Extreme_Carzz
This is a game made by Python and Pygame for the event ```pythagoras.```
This is my take on the topic given to us: ```car race```
In this game, we have to avoid crashing into the aproaching cars.

To install pygame, type: `pip install pygame` into the command prompt or terminal.


# Instrictions
(This game requires the module pygame to be installed.)
To play the game using xtreme_car_race.py `git clone` all the dependancies into a directory with the source code.
There is an executable file provided to play the game without having python installed.
All the rules of the game is given in the `Rules` section in the game.
